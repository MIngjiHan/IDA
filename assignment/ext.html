<p>
<br>
You can chose any data set(s) from the list bellow, but finding your own dataset to investigate is much more preferable (and you'll be rewarded)! <br>
If you decide to go the easier route and use some of the data sets provided, un-tar the relevant file and go to the corresponding folder.<br>
The folder contains the data set, as well as additional information
about the data. Read the available information, especially
description of the features (data dimensions).<br>
You will need to clean the data, so that it contains
only numerical features (dimensions)
and the features are space-separated (not comma-separated.
<br>

<br>
To make the plots informative, you should
come up with a labelling scheme for data points.<br>
If the data can be classified into several classes
(find out in the data and feature description!), use that information
as the basis for your labelling scheme.
In that case exclude the class information
from the data dimensions.
<br>
Alternatively, you can make labels out of any dimension,
e.g. by quantising it into several intervals. For example,
if the data dimension represents age of a person,
you can quantise it into 5 labels (classes)
[child, teenager, young adult, middle age, old].<br>
Associate the data labels with different markers and
use the markers to show what kind of data points get projected
to different regions of the visualization plot
(computer screen).

</p><ul>
<li> 
Learn as much as you can about the chosen data set using the methods
developed in the module - PCA, Clustering and SOM.
</li>
<li> 
Use various data labelling schemes. 
</li>
<li> 
Compare PCA with straightforward co-ordinate projections.
</li>
<li> 
Compare 2-dimensional topographic maps produced by SOM with PCA obtained with 2 of the leading eigen-directions.
</li>
<li> 
Illustrate the clusters obtained by clustering (on-line and batch) using SOM and PCA.
How many clusters do you need? What groupings do the clusters represent? How do they correspond to structures identified through your labelling schemes and PCA/SOM?
</li>
<li> 
Try to combine the techniques. For example, project the data onto dominant eigenvectors and then apply clustering or SOM. How do those results compare with clustering/SOM results on the original data?
</li>

Before starting to work on the assignment,
please carefully study the <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/%7Epxt/IDA/boston.ex.tar.gz">example</a>
I prepared using
the boston database.
Un-tar the file 
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/%7Epxt/IDA/boston.ex.tar.gz">boston.ex.tar.gz</a> and go to the folder
"BOSTON.EX". <br>
The subfolder "FIGURES" contains all the relevant figures
as eps or gif files.
<br>
Please consult the "boston.read.me" file in BOSTON.EX.<br>

<br>
In the labeling scheme,
concentrate on more than
one coordinate (dimension),
e.g. in the <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/%7Epxt/IDA/boston.ex.tar.gz">`boston example'</a>,
consider not just the `<u>price</u>' feature,
but run separate experiments
with `<u>per capita crime rate in the town</u>', or 
'<u>pupil-teacher ratio in the town</u>' instead of the 
`<u>price</u>' coordinate).<br>

<br>
In the report describe:<br>
- the data (10%) <br>
- how you preprocessed the data (10%) <br>
- What features (coordinates) did you use for labeling the
  projected points with different markers? What questions on the data you would like to ask. (20%) <br>
- How did you design the labeling schemes? (10%) <br>   
- What interesting aspects of the data did you detect
  based on the data visualisations/clustering? (25%) <br>
- What interesting aspects of the data did you detect
  based on  eigenvector and eigenvalue analysis of the data covariance matrix in case of PCA analysis, or codebook vector analysis in case of clustering/SOM? (25%) 
<br>

<br>
You should demonstrate that you<br>
- understand the data analysis techniques used<br>
- are able to extract useful information about otherwise
  inconceivable high-dimensional data using 
  linear/non-linear dimensionality-reduction techniques and clustering methods.
   
<p>
For examples of nice past reports developed on
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/%7Epxt/IDA/wine.tar">wine dataset</a>
(do not use this data in your report!) using just PCA, please see reports by
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/%7Epxt/IDA/christoph_stich_ex.pdf">Christoph Stich</a> and

Many thanks Chris and Joe!
